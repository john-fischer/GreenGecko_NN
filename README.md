# GreenGecko_NN
GreenGecko is a lightweight neural network library developed for Java programmers. Machine learning and its mathematical jargon both have a tendency to alienate many individuals before they give a real shot at understanding it. GreenGecko's libraries combat that notion by providing scalable and effective neural network frameworks that are easy to understand, even for someone with little to no background in machine learning. Currently a WIP as I continue to add more functionality and greater customizability.
